# Glossary

- **Scoped Answering**: Constraining the assistant to answer **only** from approved course materials and whitelisted sources; out-of-scope queries are declined with guidance.
- **Learning Trajectory**: A directed sequence/graph of topics with prerequisites used to plan and assess student progress.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: LLM answers grounded in retrieved chunks from the indexed course corpus, with citations.
- **Socratic Mode**: A guided questioning approach that surfaces misconceptions before revealing a full solution.
- **LLM Resilience (Assessment)**: The property that an assignment/exam remains fair and meaningful even if students use general LLMs; includes testability from course sources and controls that discourage shortcutting.
